# Binary-image-classification
This project focuses on exploring and understanding various neural network architectures and their application in image classification. The goal was to classify images of chihuahuas and muffins using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), DenseNets, and fully connected neural networks. The dataset used for this project contained nearly 6,000 images, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluating the performance of different models. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into how these architectures function and their effectiveness in handling image classification tasks.
